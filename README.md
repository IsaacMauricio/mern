# Notes

This is a simple project to practice as I learn Node and React. The idea of this project is to implement the "MERN" stack. As I'm learning I'll modify, update and redo some things.

The idea is to create a Markdown notes editor with an api made with Node and the app made with React. The project may grow to include other things, and may be redone using other technologies(for example, I'm already thinking about swapping Mongo for Firebase at some point, just to learn about it).
